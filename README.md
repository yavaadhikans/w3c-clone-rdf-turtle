# w3c-clone-rdf-turtle

This is a partial or pseudo-clone (for personal usage) of W3C's [**_RDF Turtle_** deliverables repository](../../w3c/rdf-turtle). I've only copied a few files from a few of that repository's commits:

- publication-snapshots
  - FPWD
    - Overview.html
    - turtle-bnf.html
    - turtle.bnf
- spec
  - index.html
  - turtle-bnf.html
  - turtle.bnf
- LICENSE.md

And then W3C's Document license instructs me to notify that:
_"Copyright © 2023 W3C®. This software or document includes material copied from or derived from the [_Specification 'rdf-turtle'_ deliverables repository](../w3c/rdf-turtle)."_
